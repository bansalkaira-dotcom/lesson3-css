<h1>TYPOGRAPHY </h1>
<H3>FONT FAMILY</H3>
<P>In typography and web design, a font family (or type family) is a collection of related fonts that share a common design
concept but vary in weight (e.g., bold), style (e.g., italic), or width (e.g., condensed).
1. Classification of Font Families
Most font families are categorized into five broad "generic" groups based on their visual characteristics:
Serif: Features small decorative lines or "feet" at the ends of character strokes. Known for a traditional, formal, and
trustworthy feel (e.g., Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond).
Sans-serif: Lacks decorative lines, resulting in a clean, modern, and minimalistic look. Widely used for digital
interfaces and screens (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Roboto).
Monospace: Every character has the same fixed horizontal width. Primarily used for computer programming and displaying
code (e.g., Courier, Lucida Console).
Cursive: Imitates human handwriting or calligraphy with fluid, connected strokes. </P>
